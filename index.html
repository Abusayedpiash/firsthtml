	<p class="letter">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.<br> Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,<br> when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.<br> It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting<br>, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,<br> and more recently<br> with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
